So, this is the first post I will be making, and oddly enough, my linux computer would not push this post, originally, so, I guess I'll just say what I said in the first post, which is, it took me quite a while to build this website, somewhere around 4 to five full working hours, which is more then i normally put into a website. so yea, here it is.
